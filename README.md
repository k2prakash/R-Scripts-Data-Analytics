# R-Scripts-Data-Analytics
This is a project that was created to compile and run R-Scripts to perform data anlaytics using R as the programming Language. 
The script performs tests such as Regression analysis, Plots such as Bar, Box and Scatter Plots.
Additionally I wrote an R-Script that combined all the knowledge I obtained with dabbling with R to produce a multi-dimensional Graph using R to plot the GDP of countries.
